    <h1 class="text-center text-primary mt-5 mb-5">EDUCATION AWARENESS PROGRAM AT PRATAPGARH </h1>
    <p class="fs-5" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">SINCE India gained independence from British rule in 1947, it has made steady progress in primary and secondary 
        education. But there are several stumbling blocks on the road to achieving the goal of universal education. 
        These include a lack of adequate funds, physical infrastructure and quality teachers. India spends only a little
         over 3% of its GDP on education against the benchmark of 6% that every national education policy has set 
         since 1968.</p>
         <p class="fs-5" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Mission Education is a national level programme of Jai maa durga dham charitable trust, an NGO for education which is
          committed
          to providing basic education and healthcare to underprivileged children. Jai maa durga dham charitable trust, an NGO for
          poor
          child education believes that whether you are addressing healthcare, poverty, population control,
          unemployment or human rights, there's no better place to start than in the corridors of education.</p>

      <p class="fs-5" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life; means, because it empowers an
          individual
          to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from
          healthcare to appropriate social behavior to understanding one's rights, and in the process evolve as a
          better citizen.</p>

      

      <p class="fs-5" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Since its inception in 2002, more than 250,000 underprivileged children have directly benefitted from
          the
          Mission Education programme</p>

                <p class="fs-5" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Every child must have access to quality education as it develops essential skills to earn a living and 
                    make informed decisions. An educated individual is more capable of navigating through hard times and 
                    contributing to the growth of society in comparison to an individual who never received formal education.
        
                    Quality education helps children realise their maximum potential and attain financial independence. 
                     Education also plays a vital role in eradicating poverty and achieving social justice. India has made 
                     great strides in increasing literacy rates across the country. The Right to Education Act 2009 enabled 
                     millions of children to get formal education. But according to the 2011 Census, there are approximately 8.4 crore
                      children in the 5-17 age group who do not go to a school. 
                    It is a matter of grave concern that such a large number of children are not getting educated.</p>
