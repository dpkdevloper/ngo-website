        <P class="fs-5" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">According to a recent report by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) up to 5 million
          girls and women
          are missing from India's population as a result of systematic gender discrimination in India. In most
          countries
          in the world, there are approximately 15 female births for every 100 males. <br>
          In India, there are less than 93 women for every 100 men in the population.
          The accepted reason for such a disparity is the practice of female infanticide in India, prompted by the
          existence of a dowry system which requires the family to pay out a great deal of money when a female child
          is married. For a poor family, the birth of girl child can signal the beginning of financial ruin and extreme
          hardship.</P>
